# A simple reminder application for Android

AlarmMe is a very basic reminder application. It was designed for personal use,
so I don't expect adding many new features any time soon. On the other hand if there is
substantial interest for specific feature, I'll consider adding it.

# Distribution
AlarmMe is a free and open source project distributed under GPLv3 licence.
AlarmMe is also available for installation from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.taradov.alarmme).
And here is QR code, just scan it with your phone and it will take you right into the Google Play search results.
